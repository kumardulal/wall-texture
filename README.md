## 🕹️ Usage

To build your own pure CSS text portrait, you need to meet the requirements below.

### 📋 Requirements

- NodeJS LTS version.
- Terminal/CMD/Bash installed or access.
- High resolution image in JPG format.

If you meet the requirements above then proceed to the steps below.

### 📝 Building Steps

1. Rename your image to `bg.jpg` (it should be in JPG, we don't need PNG lol).
2. Place your image inside `src/img`, just replace the existing image.
3. Now, edit `config.json` inside `src` folder.
4. Replace the text object inside with your own text. It can be a lyrics, a message, or a passage from a book its up to you! (I prefer personal message if this is for your loved one.)
5. Open your terminal/cmd/bash and type:

    ```cmd
    yarn install
    ```

6. Once done, type:

   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```

7. Lastly, you need to serve your builds, type:

    ```bash
    yarn run serve
    ```

    A local server should open at port `1234`
    > e.g. <http://localhost:1234>

8. You're done! 🎉

> **Note**: The output is not locally accessible. Meaning can't be viewed on your local machine without being served. I'm currently working on packaging the output after building.
